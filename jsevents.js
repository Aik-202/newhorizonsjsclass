// What is an Event?
// An event simply put refers to the thing 
// that happens to an HTML element

// JS now help us to react to those events
// This is what we call DOM Manipulation

// HTML EVENTS
// Page is loading => onload
// Input field is changed => oninputchange
// Button is clicked => onclick
// Mouse moves over an element => onmouseover
// Mouse leaves an element => onmouseleave

// Event Handlers
// JS functions that reacts to these events are 
// called event handlers

// <button onclick="hideText()" id="hidebutton">
// Event => what is happening to the button
// Clicked, onclick
// Event Handler => hideText()
// It determines what now happens when the 
// button is clicked
