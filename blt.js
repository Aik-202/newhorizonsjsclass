// Browser Loading Strategies
// How does our browser load our javascript?
// Does it load js together with the html
// Does it load the js first then the html
// Does html load before js

// window.alert("JS has been loaded")

// console.log("JS has been loaded")

// We can write javascript directly in the body
/* <script>
    window.alert("JS has been loaded")
</script> */

// We can add a source to javascript file 
// directly in the body
//  <script src="blt.js"></script> 


// When script tag appears in the head section 
// we use either of the two strategies are called async and defer
// async => loads js as soon as it sees it
// defer => loads html, then js
